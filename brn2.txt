fix receive to read propperly
networkHandler find all clients within a mapID
send mapID with request
networkHandler move tests and debugs into extension
server creates / loads: maps, tilesets, globals, items, 

tiles:

chest (place items in it)
tree (grows, has fruit in summer, looses leaves)
grassFloor
stoneFloor
brickWall
brickFloor
stoneWall



requestMapData
receiveMapData
requestEntityMove
receiveEntityMove
requestEntityChange
receiveEntityChange
requestClientMapChange
receiveClientMapChange
sendTextMessage
requestEntityAction
receiveTileChange
receiveMapUpdate

stuff:

server updates a tile every N tick
tiles then return bool if they change something
if yes, map requests a tileChange with the new tileData
if a player presses W he collets it in a NetworkRequest of type EntityMove( player.mapId, player.Id, Direction.Up.ToBytes() );
Server then evals the input, set player position, looks for all players in map and sends a NetworkAnswer of type EntityMove to all found clients

how does player to map lookup work?
are players entities? or do players reference entities?
player is entity
