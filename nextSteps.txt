fix parsing xmls
input xml
send networkRequest to server
propergate networkRequest via ID to lua
lua calls gameCore funcs

gameCore marks stuff as dirty in networkHandler
networkHandler sends networkResponse to client with ID + data
client parses networkResponse
client writes changes to clientMain
clientMain visualizes changes via screens

client sends account inf to server, server checks for player
server sends map & tileset back
